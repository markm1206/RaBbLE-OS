# Sets where the NEXT new window will open: right (→) or below (↓).
# Does NOT rearrange existing windows. Matches i3's split h / split v.
#
# Preselect is consumed by the next new window, then dwindle returns to
# its default (right). Press Super+T again before each window you want
# to open below. For persistent vertical mode, see: spawn a daemon that
# re-applies preselect on each openwindow socket event.
#
# Usage: bound to a key, no arguments.
